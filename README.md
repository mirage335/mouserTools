Converts Mouser label line numbers to component reference designators for assembly guidance.

Place Mouser invoice PDF file in current directory with scripts. Process into an ordered machine readable parts list with "invoiceToParts.sh". Run "findLineItem.sh" on a gEDAProduction CSV file. Finally, type a line number from a Mouser label.

If the component is part of the project, a reference designator will be read out, and copied to clipboard.

# Future Work
*) Keep watch on Mouser PDF file format.

*) Request Mouser maintain PDF format, or offer plain text invoice component lists.

*) Support more standaradized Centroid X/Y file and KiCAD.
